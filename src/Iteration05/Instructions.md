### Iteration 5 | Component: `CreditCard`

Create a `CreditCard` component that displays a rectangle with the information coming from the props. 

The component should take 8 props:

- `type`: A string that can be `"Visa"` or `"Master Card"`
- `number`: A string that is the number of the credit card. For security reasons, you should only display the 4 last digits ðŸ˜‰
- `expirationMonth`: A number that represents the month, between 1 and 12
- `expirationYear`: A number that represents the year
- `bank`: A string that represents the name of the bank
- `owner`: A string that represents the name of the owner
- `bgColor`: A string for the background color of the card
- `color`: A string for the text color of the card

Take your time to make the component look as close to the *expected output* as possible. You'll probably want to use flexbox.

**Example:**

```jsx
<CreditCard
  type="Visa"
  number="0123456789018845"
  expirationMonth={3}
  expirationYear={2021}
  bank="BNP"
  owner="Maxence Bouret"
  bgColor="#11aa99"
  color="white" 
/>
    
<CreditCard
  type="Master Card"
  number="0123456789010995"
  expirationMonth={3}
  expirationYear={2021}
  bank="N26"
  owner="Maxence Bouret"
  bgColor="#eeeeee"
  color="#222222"
/>
    
<CreditCard
  type="Visa"
  number="0123456789016984"
  expirationMonth={12}
  expirationYear={2019}
  bank="Name of the Bank"
  owner="Firstname Lastname"
  bgColor="#ddbb55"
  color="white" 
/>
```

**Expected Output:**
